# Anarchy16

As a child, I thought it would be wonderful to have ten brothers or sisters. Together, we could ensure a good life for our family. If everyone worked, supported, and helped each other, would it really be so hard to succeed?

A few years later, I saw a movie that I remember mainly for the antagonistâ€™s story. He and 15 others had decided to take life into their own hands, joining forces to work toward a shared, though destructive, goal. Sixteen strangers united and built relationships that became familial, perhaps even beyond that.

This idea stuck in my mind and inadvertently took on the name "Anarchy16."

Throughout my life, in a number of situations, I have dreamed of being part of such a structure. Times when I needed results in a month, yet achieving them alone would have taken me years. Or simply admiring the bonds between members of special forces who had gone through so much together, risking their lives for one another.

The concept of the "Anarchy16" initiative is to bring together like-minded individuals, helping each other reach shared goals. Through collective efforts, we can achieve common results much faster.

Our ultimate goal is to understand the universe.

We want to live freely and look into the future without fear.

We want to reach our ultimate goal in the company of happy, good-hearted members.

Let us unite!

Operator.
